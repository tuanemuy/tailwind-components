          <p class="text-neutral-400 leading-7">Hello 👋</p>

          <p class="text-neutral-400 leading-7">
            I'm Christina-CEO here at Preline.
          </p>

          <p class="text-neutral-400 leading-7">
            We're a high-growth, bootstrapped HR-tech start-up building and
            selling software that helps in-house talent acquisition teams
            attract, hire and retain the best talent.
          </p>

          <p class="text-neutral-400 leading-7">
            We launched in 2018, and have since grown to hundreds of customers,
            millions in revenue, consistent triple-digit year-on-year growth, a
            team of ~20 incredible people, and a robust and beautiful product
            used by growing organisations every day, all without taking on a
            penny of outside capital.
          </p>

          <p class="text-neutral-400 leading-7">
            The journey so far has been awesome - and we're just getting started
            - but these first signs of meaningful scale have meant our team are
            spread thin, our customer base (and their expectations of our
            product) has broadened, and it's harder to manage the competing
            priorities of our various stakeholders (customers, internal teams,
            etc.).
          </p>

          <h2 class="font-medium text-lg text-neutral-200">
            It's time for our first product manager.
          </h2>

          <p class="text-neutral-400 leading-7">
            We need someone to own product end-to-end, and (more importantly),
            we need someone with a set of skills and experience that I (CEO and
            de-facto product manager to date) don't have! The role will report
            directly into me, but you'll work closely with every leader in the
            business (Customer Success, Engineering, Sales, Marketing, etc.) and
            in time will be responsible for building out a fully-fledged product
            team.
          </p>

          <p class="text-neutral-400 leading-7">
            If this sounds like the kind of role that'd be appealing to you,
            read on - but before we dive into the detail, here are a few things
            about Unify that'll either make you say "hell, yeah", or "hell, no":
          </p>

          <ul class="flex flex-col gap-y-3 text-neutral-400">
            <li class="flex gap-x-3">
              <div class="shrink-0 size-2 mt-2 bg-neutral-600 rounded-sm"></div>
              We don't mind where you're based, but you'll need to ensure you
              have at least four hours of timezone overlap with UK to ensure we
              can work together as productively as possible. You'll need a quiet
              location to work from with good internet connectivity if you're
              working remote (we are happy to pay for access to a co-working
              space if needed).
            </li>
            <li class="flex gap-x-3">
              <div class="shrink-0 size-2 mt-2 bg-neutral-600 rounded-sm"></div>
              We're growing fast and this role is key to our growth. You'll be
              well compensated (as well as a meaningful equity allocation, great
              benefits and so on), but expectations are high and we all work
              hard here - we're not the company you join if you're looking to
              'slow down'.
            </li>
            <li class="flex gap-x-3">
              <div class="shrink-0 size-2 mt-2 bg-neutral-600 rounded-sm"></div>
              We don't work with one particular industry or size of
              organization, and we sell to all European and US time zones.
              You'll be expected to quickly understand the challenges faced by
              all of these different types of organisations, position our
              product to maximise the value we're adding to these organisations
              and so on. It's not easy.
            </li>
            <li class="flex gap-x-3">
              <div class="shrink-0 size-2 mt-2 bg-neutral-600 rounded-sm"></div>
              We're bootstrapped, profitable, and have no plans to raise
              external capital at this stage. We have a clearly defined strategy
              from today through to exit (we'll share this in detail with you
              through the hiring process) and we believe there are a number of
              huge benefits to our approach, but being bootstrapped also
              introduces challenges - our team is smaller than an average
              VC-backed business at our stage, we each carry more responsibility
              than would be typical, and we are much more intentional about how
              we deploy our capital.
            </li>
            <li class="flex gap-x-3">
              <div class="shrink-0 size-2 mt-2 bg-neutral-600 rounded-sm"></div>
              Our HQ is in Jersey, UK but we built the company to be
              remote-first and have a distributed remote team across the UK and
              US.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="font-medium text-lg text-neutral-200">
            What you'll be doing
          </h3>

          <p class="text-neutral-400 leading-7">
            You'll help us drive the product vision and development of our core
            user experience across our three main personas - in-house
            recruiters, hiring managers and their candidates.
          </p>

          <p class="text-neutral-400 leading-7">
            To do this, you'll own the complete product lifecycle - defining
            product requirements, working with the team on low-fi wireframes,
            drafting and reviewing specs and partnering with engineering,
            design, marketing, sales and customer success to deliver meaningful
            product improvements for our customers and prospects against a
            planned schedule.
          </p>

          <p class="text-neutral-400 leading-7">
            The specifics of how you allocate your time, what initiatives /
            projects you prioritise from a product perspective and so on are all
            up for grabs. The team and I all know that we need to level-up the
            way we think about product, and this role is going to help us do
            that. We're looking for someone who can very quickly ramp up (i.e.
            in weeks, not months), develop an understanding of our market,
            product, team, processes and so on - once you've done so, basically
            everything about how we deliver product is up for grabs.
          </p>

          <p class="text-neutral-400 leading-7">
            That said, if you're looking for examples of how we're spending our
            time from a product perspective at the moment, here are a few:
          </p>

          <ul class="flex flex-col gap-y-3 text-neutral-400">
            <li class="flex gap-x-3">
              <div class="shrink-0 size-2 mt-2 bg-neutral-600 rounded-sm"></div>
              Understanding our customers, their pain points, and how they're
              using our product - having direct conversations with customers,
              reviewing support requests, evaluating survey responses and
              digging into analytics.
            </li>
            <li class="flex gap-x-3">
              <div class="shrink-0 size-2 mt-2 bg-neutral-600 rounded-sm"></div>
              Reviewing our 'product stack' and implementing systems and tools
              to help streamline and scale product internally - e.g. Linear for
              issue tracking, Segment for customer data / logging, Abstract for
              design review and so on.
            </li>
            <li class="flex gap-x-3">
              <div class="shrink-0 size-2 mt-2 bg-neutral-600 rounded-sm"></div>
              Defining both a short and long-term roadmap and communicating that
              effectively both internally and externally.
            </li>
            <li class="flex gap-x-3">
              <div class="shrink-0 size-2 mt-2 bg-neutral-600 rounded-sm"></div>
              Implementing better product education (again, both internally and
              externally) - working with sales and customer success to ensure
              they're aware of new releases and the ramifications of those
              releases on our customers and prospects, and working with customer
              success specifically to ensure we're delivering a fantastic
              in-product support experience.
            </li>
            <li class="flex gap-x-3">
              <div class="shrink-0 size-2 mt-2 bg-neutral-600 rounded-sm"></div>
              Working on our ecosystem - we are strong believers in an open
              ecosystem - we want to 'stay in our lane' and focus on the ATS
              market, but have an Open API and a large (and rapidly growing)
              ecosystem of third-party integration partners that offer
              best-in-class point solutions across the wider HR Tech landscape.
              There's work to be done to improve our partner programme, better
              roadmap integrations, continually improve and better document our
              Open API, etc.
